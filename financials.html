<center>   <p style = "margin: 20 px;">         Our team is funded by partnerships with local and global bike businesses such as Trek, Giant, Cannondale, and Diamondback, as well as automobile companies like Tesla, Honda, Ford, Toyota, and more. We also participate in annual grants such as the Bike Safety For All grant, the Driver’s License Grant, and more, all of which contribute approximately ten thousand dollars to developing our product. We get sponsorships from non-for-profit organizations such as Parents for Safer Communities, Stop Car Dooring Now, and more. We also get sponsorships from automobile and bike companies, in exchange for us advertising them on our products. On the topic of our budget, we have an annual income of one million dollars, from grants, sponsorships, partnerships, and customers. We broke even just a year after we started the company, which is astounding for a company such as ours. We have grown from a local company to a global one, with outreach initiatives in the Netherlands and China. 40% of our finances goes to developing and improving our product, 20% goes to our employees’ salaries, 5% goes to participating and winning grants, 10% goes to maintenance, 10% goes to advertising and the final 15% goes to outreach and growth initiatives. Cost and materials: Sensor, camera, heat sensor (to detect people in the car), microphone (to hear car sounds), beeper, and a red light to warn cars and other vehicles. It is estimated to cost $20–$30.depending on various sizes, shapes, colors, etc without tax. All these materials are essential to creating our product, therefore adding up the total price for Bike CamSensor to be around $20 to $30. Thus, each CamSensor is priced at a reasonable $40, with varying prices for special capabilities.
