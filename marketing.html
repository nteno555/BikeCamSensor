        <h2><center>Where?</center></h2>
        <p><center>We mainly advertise in local biking communities in the Bay Area, Seattle, Boston, New York City, Chicago, and beyond, 
            because we want to ensure bike safety for both children and adults in these areas.</center></p>
        <h2><center>Where, Specifically?</center></h2>
        <p><center>We advertise our products at car and bike shops, and we put up flyers wherever we can, in mailboxes and at schools and workplaces. 
            We also advertise our products on social media platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter, ensuring that people of all backgrounds
             can get informed about our company products.</center></p>
         <h2><center>Who?</center></h2>
        <p><center>Our main clientele includes minors because they are less cautious when biking, non-for-profit organizations who want to spread 
            the CamSensor around their communities, bike and automobile companies, who want to add the CamSensor to their products, and we also have
             a huge customer base in concerned parents looking out for their childrenâ€™s welfare.</center></p>
        <h3><center>Our marketing campaign, under the brilliant directive of our Chief Marketing Officer, Calvin Li, has been highly successful, with less fatalities and injuries everywhere, and record growth in CamSensor purchases.</center></h3>
