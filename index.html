            <h4> Product Uses and Design </h4>
            <p> We wanted to create a product that alerts bikers before a potential accident</p>
             <p>  Includes:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>360 degree camera vision</li>
            <li>Heat sensors</li> 
            <li>Beepers</li>
            <li>Vehicle detectors</li>
            <li>Light</li>
            </ul>

            <img src="images-removebg-preview.png" style="float:right; overflow:auto;"/> <!--This is the picture of the bike cam sensor taken off of google images-->

            <p> Easy to latch onto bike handles by attatching it. New models come in different light colors and frequency.
              Depending on your style, sensors may vary. However, the ideal camera and light should be: 
              <ul>
                <li>Red during the day</li>
                <li>White during the night</li>
                <li>Recommended 1-4 HZ (flashes per second) </li>
            

            <h4>Grant</h4> 
            Group members Sophie Xu and Ashley Lee received a total of $35k for a grant by Katie Kim. 
            This grant money will go towards we plan to expand our products to retail stores and bike shops around the United States and other countries, 
            allowing our product to be recognized nationwide by bikers. 
            We also plan to use the money to enhance the products using a voice system to alert the biker through text-to-speech 
            and create new bike light colors. 
            With our knowledge in helping to improve the smooth experience of riding on the streets, 
            we want to use the expertise to apply safety to other transportation systems, such as scooters, 
            skateboards and electric bicycles.
