        <h2 style="color:rgb(4, 0, 27);text-decoration:underline;">History & Growth</h1>
        <p style="color: black;">Bike CamSensor was established in 2006. We came to the idea when our friend Sophie Xu got into a accident with a car door,
           when said car door opened just as she was biking by, and she was knocked to the ground, suffering from a concussion and 
           several broken bones.  Car dooring refers to an incident in which a cyclist or a motorcyclist is injured by a car door opening in their path.
           To lend our support to Sophie in her time of need and mitigate future injuries, we have developed a camera sensor that can sense when a car 
           door is about to open.</p>   
        <p style="color: black;">Over time, we have grown as a team by working relentlessly on new products that ensure bike safety. We have hired 
        employees that have experienced similar events regarding road safety and now have a determined team consisting of subteams that manufacture 
        and design CamSensor. Our company has made astonishing progress in the past couple of decades, and we are expecting more growth in the future.</p>

        <p style="color: black;">In the recent years, people haven’t really been purchasing this product because there have not been many incidents, 
          mainly due to Covid-19 and the lockdown, which haven’t allowed people to bike. However, afterward, more than one thousand cyclists and
           bikers have been in an accident, causing fatalities and severe injuries to occur. The most common deaths are caused by opening car
            doors, speeding, and lack of concentration on the road. So even though our growth dipped in 2020 and 2023, this is highly temporary and
             we predict much growth in our future.</p>
